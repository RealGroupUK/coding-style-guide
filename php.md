# PHP Style Guide

A good amount of this is "borrowed" from the WordPress style guide as a fair amount of 
Real Group development is working on WordPress code and plugins.

There are differences though, and also additional items not documented there.

## Tabs and spaces

Any code indentation must be indented to four spaces. Configure your IDE to replace **tabs** with **spaces**
to ensure that indentation remains the same in any editor.

### Associative arrays

Each item in an associative array should start on a new, indented line when the array contains more than one item:

    $array = (
        'foo' => 'bar',
        'hello' => 'world',
    );

## Single and double quotes

Use single and double quotes when appropriate. If youâ€™re not evaluating anything in the string,
use single quotes. You should almost never have to escape quotes in a string, because you can
just alternate your quoting style, like so:

    echo '<a href="/static/link" title="Yeah yeah!">Link name</a>';
    echo "<a href='$link' title='$linktitle'>$linkname</a>";
    
## Arrays

### Final commas

Final items in arrays should include a comma. This makes it easer to change the order of the array
and provides cleaner diffs in version control.

    $my_array = array(
        'foo'   => 'somevalue',
        'foo2'  => 'somevalue2',
        'foo3'  => 'somevalue3',
        'foo34' => 'somevalue3',
    );

## Brace styles

Braces must be used for all code blocks in this style:

    if ( condition ) {
        action1();
        action2();
    } elseif ( condition2 && condition3 ) {
        action3();
        action4();
    } else {
        defaultaction();
    }

Braces should use the block style, even for single conditions or when they are not required. As such,
*single-statement inline control structures* must not be used.

## Use `elseif`, not `else if`

`if|else` conditionals should favour `elseif` for consistency with label blocks.

## Opening and closing PHP tags

When adding multi-line PHP snippets in HTML, PHP open and close tags should always be on a single 
line alone.

### Short hand PHP tags

Shorthand PHP tags must never be used.

### Remove trailing whitespace
